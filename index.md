## Background & Task

Do you love a good deal and don't like being scammed into spending more than you need to ? Then you've come to the right place. Kaggle held a competition throughout a few months of 2021: <i>Shopee - Price Match Guarantee</i> [see here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching/overview). More than 2000 teams participated but only three came out victorious and with a fatter wallet. This competition was hosted by Shopee [see here](https://shopee.com/), the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Their goal is to filter out matching products at higher prices to ensure the best possible customer experience.

Our team, the <i>Shopee Price Police</i> took part in this competition as a part of the neural networks course project at the University of Tartu in Estonia. We're definetly not grandmasters of Deep Learning (yet) but nevertheless we study a few interesting approaches to this problem.
